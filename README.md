INMOST
======

INMOST is a software platform for development of parallel numerical models on general meshes.

INMOST (Integrated Numerical Modelling and Object-oriented
Supercomputing Technologies) is a supplementary tool for supercomputer numerical mathematical models
characterized by a maximum generality of supported computational meshes,
distributed data structure flexibility and cost-effectiveness, as well as cross-platform portability.
